# Bandersnatch: Data Science Monster App
## Machine Learning Engineer Edition

Deployed Example: _TOP SECRET - LINK REDACTED_


## Your Mission
As the new **ML Engineer** for the Bandersnatch project, you have a tough job
ahead of you. The previous ML Engineer dropped the ball and couldn't finish
the project. It's up to you! Your handler's name is Robert Sharp, if you get
into a jam, he can pull you out. He's one of our most loyal agents, trust him.

Your first task is to erase all traces of Eugene Albright, commit to owning
this role and put your name in their place on the home page. See
`app/templates/index.html`. Then, await further orders in the guise of 
_DS Guided Projects_, not to be confused with the social calamities known as 
_Web Guided Projects_.
